## Day 3: Lab Setup & Linux Networking (Feb 20, 2026)

### Environment Setup
Today, we set up the virtual lab that will be used for the rest of the course.
- **Hypervisor:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Guest OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS ISO
- **Host OS:** Windows

### Networking Concepts: NAT vs. Bridged
One of the most important parts of setting up a VM is networking.
1. **NAT (Network Address Translation):**
   - The VM shares the Host's IP address.
   - Good for browsing the internet from inside the VM.
   - **Downside:** The outside world (and my Host PC) cannot easily talk *in* to the VM.
2. **Bridged Adapter:**
   - The VM connects directly to the Router (Wi-Fi/LAN).
   - IT gets its own unique IP Address on the local network.
   - **Benefit:** I can ping and SSH into the Linux VM directly from my windows Terminal (Powershell/CMD), just like a real production server.

### Essential Linux Commands Executed
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `sudo apt update` | Updates the list of available packages and their versions (does not install anything). |
| `sudo apt upgrade` | Installs the newer versions of the packages you have. |
| `ip a` | Shows IP addresses and network interfaces (Modern replacement for `ifconfig`). |
| `clear` | Clears the terminal screen. |
| `exit` | Logs out of the shell. |
| `sudo poweroff` | Safely shuts down the system. |
| `init 0` | Another way to shut down (Changes system runlevel to 0). |  

### Key Takeaway
Running 'sudo apt update' **before** 'sudo apt upgrade' is mandatory.
